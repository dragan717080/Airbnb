Welcome to the Airbnb! This application is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used

The Airbnb clone is built using following technologies:

- **Next.js** - Next.js is a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), making the application fast and SEO-friendly.

- **TypeScript** - TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that it extends JavaScript by adding static typing to the language.

- **Tailwind CSS** - Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a wide range of pre-designed utility classes, allowing for rapid and flexible UI development.

At the moment its focus is on using the latest frontend technologies to provide seamless and immersive user experience. In future more features will be added.

- **App Hosted on Vercel** - <a href = 'https://airbnb-amber-pi.vercel.app/'>https://airbnb-amber-pi.vercel.app/</a>
