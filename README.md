Welcome to the Airbnb! This application is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used

The Airbnb clone is built using following technologies:

- **Next.js** - Next.js is a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), making the application fast and SEO-friendly.

- **TypeScript** - TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that it extends JavaScript by adding static typing to the language.

- **Tailwind CSS** - Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a wide range of pre-designed utility classes, allowing for rapid and flexible UI development.
